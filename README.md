# Harvest-to-Excel-Invoice-Generator
This takes a Harvest Excel sheet and converts it into an invoice using VBA as a macro. This was one of my first projects and was hard coded for my previous company. At a request I can go back and modify this if someone wants.

Couple of notes:
1) The hourly rate is hardcoded to either 15 or 18. Can be changed
2) Instructions on how to use are included in the instructions.md file
3) This code assumes that you will only have a maximum of 5 different project entries for a day. It will break if you have more.
4) The shortcut key is **ctrl+shift+y** when a cell is selected in the worksheet you wish to change
